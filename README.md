# Project overview

## Project description

This repository holds a Predictive Coordinate Descent (PCD) algorithm, and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, in order to enable decentralized proactive self-adaptation in Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (sCPS). Concretely, these algorithm were tested in wildfire tracking adaptation scenarios, included in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). For simulating UAV systems and different uncertain widlfire scenarios, Wildfire-UAVSim is used in this repository, which consists of a customizable wildfire tracking simulator that enables the evaluation of diverse adaptation strategies. For further description of the Wildfire-UAVSim simulator check [its repository](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Wildfire-UAVSim-E758/).

# Installation setup

The installation setup for executing the project, is based on Pycharm Community Edition IDE. The installation process can be checked in the **Installation setup** section in [Wildfire-UAVSim repository](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Wildfire-UAVSim-E758/). For properly installing everything needed, first follow referenced installation process, then complement each section with the described below (some section names are the same in purpose, to add information).

## Opening the project

For opening this project, instead of extracting Wildfire-UAVSim, extract the Wildfire-Simulator-DQN-PCD downloaded package in any folder, and then follow same steps as mentioned in the same section of Wildfire-UAVSim repository.

## Installing dependencies

As well as explained in Wildfire-UAVSim repository, some dependencies must be installed, keeping the same installation process. For this project, the list of dependencies grows:

<ul>
  <li>Mesa (v.1.2.1)</li>
  <li>numpy (v1.24.2)</li>
  <li>pandas (v2.0.3)</li>
  <li>plotly (v5.15.0)</li>
  <li>torch (v2.0.0)</li>
  <li>seaborn (v0.12.2)</li>
  <li>dash (v2.11.1)</li>
</ul>

Extra libraries not included in the list might be needed. In that case, follow Pycharm IDE installation recommendations when throwing dependency errors. This can be done by hovering the dependency errors in Pycharm.

# Execution of the project

Once installation set up is completed, `main.py` can be executed by selecting the file inside `./code/simulator/` folder, right mouse click, and clicking on `Run 'main'` (shortcut should be `Ctrl+Mayus+F10`).

## Project execution options

By executing `main.py` file, a list of different execution options should appear in Pycharm console:

```
