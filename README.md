# Project overview

## Project description

This repository holds a Predictive Coordinate Descent (PCD) algorithm, and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, in order to enable decentralized proactive self-adaptation in Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (sCPS). Concretely, these algorithms were tested in wildfire tracking adaptation scenarios, included in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). For simulating UAV systems and different uncertain widlfire scenarios, Wildfire-UAVSim is used in this repository, which consists in a customizable wildfire tracking simulator that enables the evaluation of diverse adaptation strategies. For further description of the Wildfire-UAVSim simulator check [its repository](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Wildfire-UAVSim-E758/).

# Installation setup

In the following subsections, the installation process for executing the project will be explained.

## Installing Pycharm Community Edition IDE

The first step is to download and install Pycharm Community Edition IDE to easily run and setup the project and its dependencies. For Linux users (this project was initially tested on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS), they can use the `snap` command in cmd (pre-installed from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and later) as a fast installation option. Users must execute the command `sudo snap install pycharm-community --classic` in cmd for installing Pycharm Community Edition.

Despite this project was initially tested on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS, it has been later tested on Windows and Mac too. For checking system requirements, and information about the installation process, please visit https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html.

## Opening the project

First extract the Wildfire-Simulator-DQN-PCD downloaded package in any folder. Second, open Pycharm by executing the command `pycharm-community` in cmd, or searching for the executable in the computer.
Then, the projects window should be opened. Next, the user has to click on `Open`, select the extracted project folder, and click `OK`. A window should appear to select between light editor, and project editor.
Select project editor. For openning the project more times, repeat same process.

## Installing dependencies

Once the project is opened, some dependencies are necessary. To install them, first go to `Settings > Project > Python Interpreter`, then select the desired Python interpreter
for executing the project. As default `/usr/bin/python3.10` should appear in the `Python Interpreter:` tab, which already contain some default dependencies if Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS is installed. For other Python interpreters,
other dependencies may be needed to be installed. On the same Pycharm configuration window, click on `+` icon, and search for the following dependencies (the user should specify the same version as the one used when developing the project. Version can be specified by clicking on the "Specify version" checkbox):

<ul>
  <li>Mesa (v.1.2.1)</li>
  <li>numpy (v1.24.2)</li>
  <li>pandas (v2.0.3)</li>
  <li>plotly (v5.15.0)</li>
  <li>torch (v2.0.0)</li>
  <li>seaborn (v0.12.2)</li>
  <li>dash (v2.11.1)</li>
</ul>

Extra dependencies not included in the list might be needed. In that case, follow Pycharm IDE installation recommendations when throwing dependency errors. This can be done by hovering the dependency errors in Pycharm.

# Execution of the project

Once installation set up is completed, `main.py` can be executed by selecting the file inside `./code/simulator/` folder, right mouse click, and clicking on `Run 'main'` (shortcut should be `Ctrl+Shift+F10`).

## Graphical interface functionalities

When executing the project as explained above, a web page hosted in http://127.0.0.1:8521/ should appear in user's default browser. Port can be modified in `main.py` file if user has the default one already busy.

The relevant graphical interface elements are show in the following table:

| Element | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `Grid` | The grid with generated cells, with vegetation, fire, smoke, and UAVs, can be seen in the center of the screen. |
| `Start button` | The start button allows to run the simulation without stopping. |
| `Step button` | The step button allows to execute one time step at a time. |
| `Reset button` | The reset button allows to execute the `reset()` method, inherited and overwritten from Mesa framework class `mesa.Model`, into WildFireModel class, inside `widlfire_model.py` file. |
| `Frames per second` | It is a slider that allows to set the frames per second (FPS) velocity for the graphical visualization of the simulation execution. Each frame corresponds to one time step. Its range goes from 1 to 20 FPS, taking into account that, counterintuitively, 0 FPS set the fastest FPS velocity. One reason why the simulation might seem not be playing fluently could be the setting of the `FIRE_SPREAD_SPEED` variable referenced below. |
| `Current step counter` | Indicates the current time step of the simulation. |

## Project execution options

By executing `main.py` file, a list of different execution options should appear in Pycharm console:

```
------------ COMMON_FIXED_VARIABLES.PY ------------
--------------------- OPTIONS: --------------------
1. Train DQN
2. DQN automatic evaluation
3. PCD automatic evaluation
4. Random selection automatic evaluation (future RNN/LSTM/etc)
5. DQN interface evaluation
6. Random selection interface evaluation (future RNN/LSTM/etc)
SELECT AN OPTION (introduce an int number):
```

`1. Train DQN` This option allows to train DQN algorithm. Concretely, model checkpoints will appear in `.results/DQN/training_checkpoints/` directory. Take into account that when executing options for doing inference with DQN, model checkpoints in this directory will be used (**by default, pre-loaded model checkpoints for testing with each UAV amount, are hold in the repository. Take into account that these checkpoints were obtained from training DQN on normal conditions scenarios**). Also, training metrics results will appear in `.results/DQN/training_results/` directory, in the shape of files such as `*UAV_training_results.txt`, for each corresponding UAV amount.

`2. DQN automatic evaluation` This option will execute an automatic process for evaluating DQN performance in a certain wildfire scenario. Concretely, results will appear in `.results/DQN/inference_results/` directory, in the shape of folders such as `*UAV_run_rewards` (including statistics plotting each obtained reward with respect to its corresponding time step, for each simulation), files such as `*UAV.txt` (each row is the result of obtaining effective wildfire monitoring metric on each simulation), and such as `COUNTER_*UAV.txt` (each row is the result of obtaining collision risk avoidance metric on each simulation), for each UAV amount, respectively.

`3. PCD automatic evaluation` This option will execute an automatic process for evaluating PCD performance in a certain wildfire scenario. Concretely, results will appear in `.results/PCD/inference_results/` directory, in the shape of folders such as `*UAV_run_rewards` (including statistics plotting each obtained reward with respect to its corresponding time step, for each simulation), files such as `*UAV.txt` (each row is the result of obtaining effective wildfire monitoring metric on each simulation), and such as `COUNTER_*UAV.txt` (each row is the result of obtaining collision risk avoidance metric on each simulation), for each UAV amount, respectively. Also, for PCD automatic evaluation, each grid time step of each simulation will be plot in `.results/PCD/inference_grid_instants/` (since it has not graphical web interface evaluation).

`4. Random selection automatic evaluation (future RNN/LSTM/etc)` This option will execute an automatic process for evaluating random selection performance in a certain wildfire scenario. Concretely, results will appear in `.results/DQN/inference_results/` directory (**random selection has not its own directory**), in the shape of folders such as `*UAV_run_rewards` (including statistics plotting each obtained reward with respect to its corresponding time step, for each simulation), files such as `*UAV.txt` (each row is the result of obtaining effective wildfire monitoring metric on each simulation), and such as `COUNTER_*UAV.txt` (each row is the result of obtaining collision risk avoidance metric on each simulation), for each UAV amount, respectively.

`5. DQN interface evaluation` This option will execute the graphical web interface for evaluating DQN algorithm. Also, statistics will be plot in the shape of images, such as `*_EVAL_drones_pyfoo.svg` for the concrete UAV amount. Statistics will plot each obtained reward with respect to its corresponding time step, for each simulation.

`6. Random selection interface evaluation (future RNN/LSTM/etc)` This option will execute the graphical web interface for evaluating random selection. Also, statistics will be plot in the shape of images, such as `*_EVAL_drones_pyfoo.svg` for the concrete UAV amount. Statistics will plot each obtained reward with respect to its corresponding time step, for each simulation.

# Annex: Common variables configuration

Global variables are used in the project to configure different simulation executions. In the next subsections several global variables descriptions are shown, as well as many configuration examples for execution.

## Variables description

### Forest area

| Variable name | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `BATCH_SIZE` | It establishes how long the simulation will run, in number of time steps |
| `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT` | They set the grid size (forest area size) in cells |
| `BURNING_RATE` | It sets the fuel decay speed in terms of time steps |
| `FIRE_SPREAD_SPEED` | It sets how fast fire spreads to other cells, in terms of time steps |
| `FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT`, `FUEL_BOTTOM_LIMIT` | They establish the maximum and minimum amount of burnable fuel present in each cell, respectively |
| `DENSITY_PROB` | It is a value in the range `[0, 1]` that establishes the percentage of the grid covered by vegetation |

### Wind

| Variable name | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `ACTIVATE_WIND` | It sets whether the fire spread is influenced by wind |
| `FIXED_WIND` | If it is active, then wind blows in the direction set by `WIND_DIRECTION`. If it is not, it means wind blows two directions, specified by `FIRST_DIR` and `SECOND_DIR`. Since wind can blow a direction stronger than the other one, `FIRST_DIR_PROB` establishes the wind first directionâ€™s predominance |
| `PROBABILITY_MAP` | If it is active, the probability of the fire to spread to each cell at all times can be visualized |
| `MU` | It sets how strong wind blows with a value in the range `[0, 1]` |

### Smoke

| Variable name | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `ACTIVATE_SMOKE` | It sets whether smoke will be part of the simulation |
| `SMOKE_PRE_DISPELLING_COUNTER` | It establishes how fast smoke appears after fire starts in a cell |

### UAV

| Variable name | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `NUM_AGENTS` | It establishes the amount of UAVs that will fly over the forest area (zero indicates the simulator will simulate only the wildfire spread) |
| `N_ACTIONS` | Specifies the number of possible actions each UAV can take when deciding on a move, which by default is set as `[north, east, west, south]` |
| `UAV_OBSERVATION_RADIUS` | It sets the observation radiusâ€”technically it is not really a radius, since observed areas have square shapes |
| `SECURITY_DISTANCE` | It establishes the minimum distance that UAVs should be separated from each other for avoiding collisions |

## Configuration examples

Six default examples of how different variables can be configured to develop distinct scenarios, can be seen below. All scenarios shown are captured in `time step = 20`, in different time steps scenarios might look different.

### Common default variables

Before showing the examples, this section compiles all variables that can be set in common with all examples. The variables that were not mentioned can be set to their default value.

| Variable name | Value |
|----------|----------|
| `BATCH_SIZE` | 90 |
| `WIDTH` | 50 |
| `HEIGHT` | 50 |
| `BURNING_RATE` | 1 |
| `FIRE_SPREAD_SPEED` | 2 |
| `FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT` | 10 |
| `FUEL_BOTTOM_LIMIT` | 7 |
| `DENSITY_PROB` | 1 |

### Normal conditions (no smoke, no wind, no UAV)

A scenario with no wind, smoke, or UAV, should appear.

| Variable name | Value |
|----------|----------|
| `NUM_AGENTS` | 0 |
| `ACTIVATE_WIND` | False |
| `ACTIVATE_SMOKE` | False |
| `PROBABILITY_MAP` | False |

### Windy conditions (no smoke, wind, no UAV)

Concretely, a scenario with two weak wind components should appear, first with 50% of south component, and a second west component with 50%. In this scenario, neither smoke or UAV should appear.

| Variable name | Value |
|----------|----------|
| `NUM_AGENTS` | 0 |
| `ACTIVATE_WIND` | True |
| `ACTIVATE_SMOKE` | False |
| `PROBABILITY_MAP` | False |
| `FIXED_WIND` | False |
| `WIND_DIRECTION` | 'south' |
| `FIRST_DIR` | 'south' |
| `SECOND_DIR` | 'west' |
| `FIRST_DIR_PROB` | 0.5 |
| `MU` | 0.5 |

### Windy and partial observabiliy conditions (smoke, wind, no UAV)

A scenario with strong windy conditions, blowing east, and late short-lasting smoke should appear. Remember that, since the dispelling counter for smoke is set in `Smoke` class by default, inside `agents.py` file, changes should be done to the `self.dispelling_counter_start_value` variable, inside `__init()__` method (`Smoke` class). Keep also in mind that `self.dispelling_counter_start_value + SMOKE_PRE_DISPELLING_COUNTER` should be greater than the amount of fuel assigned to each cell (for taking less risks, compare to `FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT`, which is the maximum possible amount of fuel of each cell), in order to avoid situations in which smoke dissipates before the end of the cellâ€™s burning process.

| Variable name | Value |
|----------|----------|
| `NUM_AGENTS` | 0 |
| `ACTIVATE_WIND` | True |
| `ACTIVATE_SMOKE` | True |
| `PROBABILITY_MAP` | False |
| `FIXED_WIND` | True |

| `PROBABILITY_MAP` | False |
| `SMOKE_PRE_DISPELLING_COUNTER` | 2 |
| `self.dispelling_counter_start_value` | 9 |
| `UAV_OBSERVATION_RADIUS` | 12 |

### Probabaility map

A scenario with normal conditions should appear. Keep in mind that changing wind conditions will affect to the visualized probabilitites. Also, remember to set 0 UAV when showing the fire probability map.

| Variable name | Value |
|----------|----------|
| `NUM_AGENTS` | 0 |
| `ACTIVATE_WIND` | False |
